Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0,a1,a32 contain arguments of functions. a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
It seems that the compiler has inline the f function, which means the compiler calculate f(8)+1
to 12, and not explicitly call f function.

At what address is the function printf located?
0x642

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
The value in ra register is 0x38, which is the next instruction address after jalr instructions.
